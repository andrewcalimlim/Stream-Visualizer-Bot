This is a Discord bot for the ITG community that visualizes arrow inputs (Left = L, Down = D, Up = U, Right = R) (Jumps too!)

It uses images of green, blue, and red arrows uploaded to Discord as emotes to create a pattern of arrows
akin to what you would see in ITG.

Here is an example of it's usage:

In Version 1.1, I added multi-note row support (like jumps or brackets).

To replicate this bot you will need Node.js installed and your own authorization Discord bot token.

I used this tutorial to set it up:
