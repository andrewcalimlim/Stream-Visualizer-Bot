This is a Discord bot for the dance game community that visualizes arrow inputs (Left = L, Down = D, Up = U, Right = R)

It uses images of green, blue, and red arrows uploaded to Discord as emotes to create a pattern of arrows
akin to what you would see in ITG.

To replicate this bot you will need Node.js installed and your own authorization Discord bot token.

I used this tutorial to set it up:
